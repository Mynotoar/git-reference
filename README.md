# Git Reference Notes

This repository contains rough notes I have compiled about the easiest, most straightforward, most user-friendly version control software out there*, Git.

These notes are not complete and should not be taken as authoritative, but are compilations of what I've gathered from various sources and at least 2 years of attempting to use Git in some professional capacity.
